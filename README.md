# Face_Generation_DCGAN

I build a generative adversarial (GAN) network to generate new images of faces.

This is actually DCGAN ( Deep convolutional GAN) with two convolutional neural network named generator and discriminator. Generator build new faces and trys to fool discriminator where discriminator says a picture real face or fake face.

The GAN is built on pytorch, written in Python 3 and is presented via Jupyter Notebook.
